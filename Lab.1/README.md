# Lab.1  
In this lab, we were introduced to the concept of **symbols, rules and alphabet**, which we will use in the next sessions to create different types of automatons.  
Firstly, we made two functions in python: one that reads from input a matrix, and the latter which reads from a file the matrix and prints it. Then, we made a parser for a file, from which we extract symbols, rules and an alphabet.
