# Interactive game using a DFA  
This game simulates a labyrinth. You have this map:  
```
       [mega_exit]
           |
       [secret_room]
           |
[kitchen]--[hallway]--[library]
           |              |
       [entrance]       [exit]
```
You can move up, down, left, right. You can also pick up a spoon from the kitchen. You can get through the mega_exit **only if you have the spoon**.
