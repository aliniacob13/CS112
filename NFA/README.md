## Introduction to NFAs

A **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)** extends the concept of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) by allowing multiple possible transitions for the same-state and input-symbol pair, as well as Œµ-transitions (sometimes called Œª-transitions). In practical terms, an NFA can ‚Äúbranch‚Äù into several possible next states on a given input, or even move to a new state without consuming any input symbol (via an Œµ-transition).

- NFAs recognize exactly the same class of languages as DFAs (the regular languages). However, NFAs can sometimes be more concise or more intuitive to construct than equivalent DFAs.
- In an NFA, an input string is accepted if at least one of the possible ‚Äúbranches‚Äù of execution ends in an accepting state after reading the entire string.

---

## Nondeterminism vs. Determinism

1. **Deterministic Model (DFA)**  
   - At each step in the computation, there is exactly one possible transition to follow for the current state and the next input symbol.  
   - If the unique path of transitions ends in an accepting state, the input is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.

2. **Nondeterministic Model (NFA)**  
   - At each step, there may be **multiple** possible transitions for the same (state, input-symbol) pair.  
   - Additionally, Œµ-transitions allow the automaton to change state without reading an input symbol.  
   - The input is accepted if **any one** of the possible computation paths leads to an accepting state after the entire input has been consumed.

> **Key Point:** Although NFAs can ‚Äúbranch‚Äù into multiple possibilities, they do **not** recognize more languages than DFAs. Every NFA has an equivalent DFA, though the DFA may have exponentially more states in the worst case.

## Formal Definition of an NFA

Formally, an NFA is a 5-tuple N = (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q‚ÇÄ, F)  
where:

1. **Q** is a finite set of states.  
2. **Œ£** is a finite input alphabet (a set of symbols).  
3. **Œ¥ : Q √ó (Œ£ ‚à™ {Œµ}) ‚Üí ùí´(Q)** is the transition function, mapping a state and either an input symbol or Œµ to a **set** of possible next states.  
4. **q‚ÇÄ ‚àà Q** is the start state.  
5. **F ‚äÜ Q** is the set of accepting (final) states.

- **Œ¥(q, a) = {r‚ÇÅ, r‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶}** means that from state `q`, upon reading symbol `a`, the NFA may transition nondeterministically to any of the states in that set.
- **Œ¥(q, Œµ) = {r‚ÇÉ, ‚Ä¶}** represents Œµ-transitions (also commonly written as Œ¥(q, Œª) or Œ¥(q, $)), which move from `q` to any of those states without consuming any input symbol.

When processing an input string `w = a‚ÇÅ a‚ÇÇ ‚Ä¶ a‚Çô`, the NFA keeps track of all possible current states simultaneously. At each position in the input:

1. First, apply all Œµ-closures (i.e., follow any number of Œµ-transitions) from each current state.  
2. Then, read the next symbol `ai` and move into every reachable state via Œ¥ on that symbol.  
3. Apply Œµ-closure again before reading the next input symbol.  
4. At the end of the string, if **any** of the possible current states belongs to `F`, the NFA accepts.

## How an NFA Operates

1. **Initialization**  
   - Start from the initial state `q‚ÇÄ`.  
   - Compute the Œµ-closure of `{q‚ÇÄ}`, which is the set of all states reachable from `q‚ÇÄ` using only Œµ-transitions (including `q‚ÇÄ` itself). This is the set of ‚Äúactive‚Äù states before reading any input.

2. **Processing Each Input Symbol**  
   For each symbol `a` in the input string, do the following in sequence:  
   - Let `Current` be the set of active states from the previous step (or Œµ-closure).  
   - Compute `Move = ‚ãÉ { Œ¥(q, a) | q ‚àà Current }`. In other words, take all possible transitions on `a` from every state in `Current`.  
   - Compute `Next = Œµ-closure(Move)`. Follow Œµ-transitions from each state in `Move` to form the new set of active states.  
   - Set `Current ‚Üê Next` and proceed to the next symbol.

3. **Acceptance Check**  
   - After the last symbol has been consumed and Œµ-closure has been applied, check if `Current ‚à© F ‚â† ‚àÖ`.  
   - If there is at least one accepting state in the set of current states, the NFA accepts the string; otherwise, it rejects.

> **Note on Œµ-closure:**  
> - The Œµ-closure of a set `S ‚äÜ Q` is defined as the smallest set `C ‚äÜ Q` such that:  
>   1. `S ‚äÜ C`, and  
>   2. for every state `p ‚àà C`, if `Œ¥(p, Œµ) = {r‚ÇÅ, r‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶}`, then all those `r·µ¢` are also in `C`.  
> - In practice, one computes Œµ-closure by repeatedly adding states reachable via Œµ until no new states appear.

## Designing an NFA

When constructing an NFA for a specific regular-language recognition task, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. **Identify Key Subtasks or Patterns**  
   - Determine the minimal ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù of behavior needed to recognize the language.  
   - For example, if the language is ‚Äúall strings containing the substring `ab`,‚Äù then one subtask is ‚Äúdetect an `a` and then check whether a `b` follows.‚Äù

2. **Introduce Œµ-Transitions to Handle ‚ÄúNondeterministic Guesses‚Äù**  
   - Use Œµ-transitions when you wish to ‚Äúbranch‚Äù into a new computation path without consuming input.  
   - This is especially helpful for languages that require checking multiple overlapping conditions (e.g., multiple substrings) in parallel.

3. **Keep Track of Partial Progress**  
   - Assign each state a clear semantic meaning, such as ‚Äúwe have read one `a` and are awaiting a `b`,‚Äù or ‚Äúwe have recognized the substring and can now loop freely.‚Äù  
   - Avoid introducing extraneous states; each state should correspond to a necessary distinction in the process of recognition.

4. **Multiple Transitions on the Same Symbol**  
   - In an NFA, it is valid for `Œ¥(q, a)` to contain two or more different next states.  
   - This means that upon reading `a` from state `q`, the machine can nondeterministically follow any of those outgoing edges.

5. **Use Œµ-Transitions to Reset or ‚ÄúForget‚Äù**  
   - If part of your recognition requires ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù a partial match and restarting, an Œµ-transition can move you back to an initial or intermediate state without consuming a new symbol.  
   - This simplifies the design of many regular-language recognizers by avoiding complicated loops.

## Example: Recognizing Strings That Contain ‚Äúab‚Äù

Below is a step-by-step description for constructing an NFA that accepts all strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` which contain the substring `ab` at least once.

### 1. Define States

- **q‚ÇÄ**: the start state. In this state, no part of the substring `ab` has been recognized so far.  
- **q‚ÇÅ**: an intermediate state meaning ‚Äúan `a` has just been read, so if a `b` follows immediately, we complete `ab`.‚Äù  
- **q‚ÇÇ**: an accepting (final) state meaning ‚Äúwe have recognized `ab`.‚Äù Once this state is reached, the string should be accepted‚Äîregardless of any further symbols.

### 2. Define the Alphabet

- Œ£ = `{a, b}`.

### 3. Define the Transition Function Œ¥

We construct Œ¥ as a mapping from `(state, symbol/Œµ)` to a set of possible next states.

1. **From q‚ÇÄ**  
   - On `a`:  
     - Stay in q‚ÇÄ (to allow skipping over `a` if it is not the start of the first `ab`).  
       ```
       Œ¥(q‚ÇÄ, a) includes q‚ÇÄ
       ```  
     - Move to q‚ÇÅ (to guess that this `a` might be the start of `ab`).  
       ```
       Œ¥(q‚ÇÄ, a) includes q‚ÇÅ
       ```  
   - On `b`:  
     - Stay in q‚ÇÄ (since `b` by itself does not help form `ab`, but we can continue scanning).  
       ```
       Œ¥(q‚ÇÄ, b) includes q‚ÇÄ
       ```

2. **From q‚ÇÅ**  
   - On `b`:  
     - Move to q‚ÇÇ (we successfully recognized `ab`).  
       ```
       Œ¥(q‚ÇÅ, b) = {q‚ÇÇ}
       ```  
   - On `a`:  
     - (No direct `a`‚Üí transition required, since if we see another `a`, we can still consider that new `a` as the start of a fresh `ab`. In practice, we will use an Œµ-transition to fall back.)  
   - On Œµ:  
     - Move back to q‚ÇÄ (so that if we guessed ‚Äústart of `ab`‚Äù but then saw something else, we can reset to q‚ÇÄ and try again nondeterministically).  
       ```
       Œ¥(q‚ÇÅ, Œµ) = {q‚ÇÄ}
       ```

3. **From q‚ÇÇ**  
   - q‚ÇÇ is a final state. We can choose to loop on `a` or `b` and remain in q‚ÇÇ, because once `ab` is found, the string should be accepted regardless of what comes next:  
     ```
     Œ¥(q‚ÇÇ, a)  = {q‚ÇÇ}
     Œ¥(q‚ÇÇ, b)  = {q‚ÇÇ}
     Œ¥(q‚ÇÇ, Œµ)  = ‚àÖ   (no need for Œµ here, since we already accept)
     ```  
   - By including loops on both `a` and `b` from q‚ÇÇ to q‚ÇÇ, we ensure that any suffix after the first `ab` does not cause rejection.

### 4. Summarize Œ¥ in Tabular Form

| Current State | Input Symbol | Next State(s)   |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| q‚ÇÄ            | a            | { q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ }      |
| q‚ÇÄ            | b            | { q‚ÇÄ }          |
| q‚ÇÄ            | Œµ            | ‚àÖ               |
| q‚ÇÅ            | b            | { q‚ÇÇ }          |
| q‚ÇÅ            | Œµ            | { q‚ÇÄ }          |
| q‚ÇÅ            | a            | ‚àÖ               |
| q‚ÇÇ            | a            | { q‚ÇÇ }          |
| q‚ÇÇ            | b            | { q‚ÇÇ }          |
| q‚ÇÇ            | Œµ            | ‚àÖ               |

- Note that Œ¥ is defined on Œ£ ‚à™ {Œµ}.  
- When Œ¥(p, x) is empty (‚àÖ), it means no transition exists for symbol x from state p.

### 5. Start and Accepting States

- **Start state:** q‚ÇÄ  
- **Accepting (final) state:** q‚ÇÇ (only)

### 6. Operation Walk-Through

1. **Initialization**  
   - Active states = Œµ-closure({q‚ÇÄ}) = {q‚ÇÄ} (since q‚ÇÄ has no incoming Œµ from itself).

2. **Reading an input string**  
   - Suppose the input is `b a b a`. We simulate step by step:  
     1. **Symbol** `b` from q‚ÇÄ:  
        - Move: Œ¥(q‚ÇÄ, b) = {q‚ÇÄ}.  
        - Œµ-closure({q‚ÇÄ}) = {q‚ÇÄ}.  
     2. **Symbol** `a` from q‚ÇÄ:  
        - Move: Œ¥(q‚ÇÄ, a) = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ}.  
        - Œµ-closure({q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ}) = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ, (and from q‚ÇÅ you get Œµ‚Üíq‚ÇÄ which is already in the set)} = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ}.  
     3. **Symbol** `b` from the set {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ}:  
        - Move from q‚ÇÄ on b ‚Üí {q‚ÇÄ}.  
        - Move from q‚ÇÅ on b ‚Üí {q‚ÇÇ}.  
        - Combined Move = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÇ}.  
        - Œµ-closure({q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÇ}) = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÇ} (no additional Œµ transitions apply).  
     4. **Symbol** `a` from {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÇ}:  
        - Move from q‚ÇÄ on a ‚Üí {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ}.  
        - Move from q‚ÇÇ on a ‚Üí {q‚ÇÇ}.  
        - Combined Move = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ, q‚ÇÇ}.  
        - Œµ-closure({q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ, q‚ÇÇ}) = {q‚ÇÄ, q‚ÇÅ, q‚ÇÇ}.  

   - After the final input symbol, the active set contains q‚ÇÇ, which is accepting, so the NFA accepts `baba`.

3. **Key Observation**  
   - As soon as the NFA reaches q‚ÇÇ at any intermediate step, it can remain in q‚ÇÇ forever (or move back via Œµ if we had chosen that path‚Äîbut since q‚ÇÇ loops on every input, that branch will remain accepting).  
   - If one computational branch dies (no valid transition at some symbol), other branches may still survive and possibly accept.

## Additional Remarks and Tips

1. **Conversion to DFA (Subset Construction)**  
   - Every NFA can be converted to an equivalent DFA using the subset (powerset) construction.  
   - In that construction, each DFA state corresponds to a set of NFA states (an ‚ÄúŒµ-closure set‚Äù).  
   - Although conceptually straightforward, the resulting DFA may have up to 2^|Q| states in the worst case.

2. **Use of Œµ-Transitions**  
   - Œµ-transitions make certain regular expressions (e.g., `(a|b)*ab(a|b)*`) easier to implement directly.  
   - However, one can always eliminate Œµ-transitions by computing Œµ-closures and adjusting Œ¥ accordingly, yielding an NFA without Œµ‚Äôs.

3. **Design Strategy**  
   - Identify ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù substrings or conditions in your target language‚Äîfor example, ‚Äú`ab` appears somewhere,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe string ends with `01`,‚Äù etc.  
   - Model each landmark as a distinct state (or set of states).  
   - Use Œµ-transitions to ‚Äúreset‚Äù or branch when multiple possibilities must be pursued simultaneously.

4. **Nondeterministic ‚ÄúGuess and Check‚Äù**  
   - An NFA can guess (via nondeterministic branching) that a certain position in the input might be the start of a pattern. If that guess fails later, the automaton can fall back (via Œµ) and continue from a different point.  
   - This approach often leads to a smaller, more intuitive NFA than a directly constructed DFA.

5. **Limitation of Branches**  
   - While we think of NFAs as splitting into many ‚Äúparallel branches,‚Äù an actual implementation typically does a breadth-first or depth-first search over the state graph.  
   - In theoretical terms, those branches do not require extra memory‚Äînondeterminism is a conceptual tool, not a literal duplication of computations.
